Number of Unique Observations

The number of unique rows by a group can easily be calculated with PROC FREQ and PROC MEANS. 
The following program explains how we can calculate number of observations in a categorical variable with Data Step.

data aaa2;
set abcd (drop = y);
retain z;
if first.x then z = 1;
else z = z + 1;
by x;
if last.x then output;
run;

****Suppose you have more than 1 grouping variable****;
data temp;
input ID ID1 Score;
cards;
1 1 25
1 1 26
1 2 27
1 2 29
2 1 28
2 1 29
2 2 31
;
run;
data temp2;
set temp;
by ID ID1;
if first.ID or first.ID1 then N = 1;
else N+1;
proc print;
run;
****When you have more than 1 grouping variable, we can use multiple FIRST. statements with OR operator to generate serial numbers****;
